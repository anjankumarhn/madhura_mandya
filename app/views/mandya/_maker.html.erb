The Jog and Shimsha power station was also established during his regime. Rural electrification was given importance during his period and was the first of its kind in India. His dedication and exceptional efforts towards total industrial development are evident in the Bhadravathi paper and cement factory, Bangalore Aeronautics factory, Mandya sugar factory, Belagola chemical and fertilizers. He also gave importance to sericulture and rural industries. If Dr.M.Vishveshwaraiah paved the way for the eventual establishment of the sugar industry, the credit for actually bringing the factory into existence should go to Sir M.Mirza Ismail who was largely instrumental in sponsoring the company by taking advantage of the favourable opportunity presented by the grant of protection to the sugar industry in 1932. Brindavan Gardens, the illuminated terrace garden situated below the Krishnaraj Sagara dam was the result of the endeavors of  Late Sir Mirza Ismail to whom the plan and layout of the gardens owe a lot.

Colman was not restricted to the Laboratory. He carried out his research results from the lab to the land. He contributed very much in the eradication of weeds in agricultural fields particularly the species of Lantana. He devised many agricultural instruments, amongst which, worth mentioning is the ‘Kolara Plough’ which is popular even today through out the district. He gave a modern approach in the cultivation of crops by the application of nutrients, green manure and also by transplantation methodology. He wandered all over the district with his old motor cycle sharing the farmer’s experiences. Although Colman was retired from the service after a year of the commencement of the factory, he had an emotional relationship with all the institutions, which he founded, in the district till his last breath.
